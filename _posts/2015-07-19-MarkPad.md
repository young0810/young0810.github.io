#MarkPad

##Side-by-side Preview
Markdown is easy to grok, but how do you know its going to turn out perfect? A side-by-side preview, rendered in real time, thats how!

##Feature Rich
Feature Rich, open and save directly to your blog, github and more, paste images from the clipboard into Markdown, Jekyll Site and Open from folder support plus much more!

##Spellchecker
Markdown can be done in any text editor, but why must the experience degrade to Notepad? No more. MarkPad has spellchecker and a floating syntax tool bar
